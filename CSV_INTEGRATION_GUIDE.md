2. Click **Create collection**
3. Name it something like "CSV Imported Products" or "Featured Products"
4. Set the collection type to **Manual** or **Automated** (depending on your needs)
5. Add your CSV-imported products to this collection

### Step 3: Configure the Custom Grid Section
1. Go to your Shopify admin â†’ **Online Store** â†’ **Themes**
2. Click **Customize** on your active theme
3. Navigate to the page where you want to add the product grid

3. The grid will automatically display the first 6 products from your collection
4. Save your changes

3. Upload a background image if desired
4. Save your changes
